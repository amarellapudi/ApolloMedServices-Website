# ApolloMedServices-Website

Made a professional website for the Apollo Medical Services clinics.

This was my first exposure to HTML/CSS. The following YouTube video was extremely helpful for some of the crucial basics.<br>

The following links helped me put together the email form.<br>

Highlights:
- Responsive, works on mobile and desktop
- PHP email form
- Google Maps location information
  
Bugs:
- Footer not always on the bottom of the screen (especially with larger displays)
